Get Started
===========

Installing nBox is as simple as configuring our repository following the instructions
at http://packages.ntop.org and installing the **nbox** package using apt on Ubuntu 16.

After installing the package, it is possible to access the GUI connecting to the 
machine's IP address using a browser (Chrome, Firefox and Safari are supported).
